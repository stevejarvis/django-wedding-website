            <h3>Getting There and Away</h3>
            <p>River Falls is located about 40 minutes east from the Minneapolis airport. If you're flying, MSP is kinda
              the only reasonable option.</p>

            <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
            <p>
                Steve and Allie will be staying in Hudson, and that's where most of the reserved rooms are. There are also a few right in
                River Falls, for those that want to avoid the 20 minute commute.
            </p>
            <p>We will provide a shuttle between the venue and the hotels in both locations. There's also (recently) Lyft available in the area.
